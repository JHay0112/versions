            <p><br>In October 1939, the President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt received a letter from Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard, outlining how a devastating bomb could be created using the process of nuclear fission. The two scientists had fled Europe to escape Nazism, also outlined their fears that Nazi-Germany was already developing these weapons and that if the Germans succeeded in building one that Nazi-Germany would be able to win the war.</p><br>
            
            <p>Einstein and Szilard continued on in their letter to urge the US government to design and build an atomic bomb of their own. Roosevelt agreed, and in conjunction with the UK, the incredibly secret project that was known as “The Manhattan Project” began. The “Manhattan Project” eventually employed more than 200,000 workers and several thousand scientists and engineers. On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was tested in the Alamogordo desert in New Mexico. The power of the atomic bomb astonished even the people who had designed and constructed it.</p><br>
                
            <p>By the time of the test in Alamogordo test, Nazi-Germany had already surrendered to the allied forces, this meant that any potential threat of a Nazi atomic bomb no longer existed. But WWII still continued between the Japanese and the allied forces in the pacific. The president of the USA at the time, Harry S, Truman decided to use their atomic bombs to force the Japanese to surrender. On August 6th, 1945, an atomic bomb with the yield of 12.5 kilotons was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. It killed 70,000 people instantly and another 70,000 at least from radiation. On August 9th, 1945, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki with a yield of 22 kilotons. It caused fewer deaths but survivors suffered from burns and radiation sickness. Five years later, up to 340,000 people died from the two bombs.</p>

            <h2>Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</h2>

            <p><br>After the Japanese surrender, many people called for a ban on the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons to avoid future catastrophes. Both the US and USSR agreed (that’s a first) that the atomic bomb should be put under international control. Despite the agreement, the two main powers never gave up their nuclear weapon programmes. By 1946 it was obvious that the effort to stop these weapons being developed had failed. The USSR had already launched its own nuclear programme, in the hope of catching up with the US. Thanks to espionage, Soviet scientists built a blueprint for the fission bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki and had a working version by 1949.</p><br>
            
            <p>When the USA realised that the USSR had become a nuclear nation, the President of the time, Harry S. Truman, decided that the USA should focus efforts on developing a more powerful bomb that harnessed the incredible power of nuclear fusion. They would be called the hydrogen bomb (also known as H-bomb, and thermonuclear weapons), and would use a small fission bomb to trigger a more powerful fusion explosion.</p><br>
            
            <p>By 1954 both the USSR and the USA had developed and tested their H-Bombs. These tests proved that the H-Bomb was thousands of times better than the traditional fission bomb. The most powerful explosion was the test of the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba in Novaya Zemlya, an island above Russia. Estimations put the explosive power at more than all the bombs and explosives, including the two nuclear bombs, used in WWII.</p><br>
            
            <p>By 1961, both the UK and France had developed and tested their own nuclear weapons. The UK had developed their own nuclear weapons in close partnership with the USA. The French developed their own nuclear weapons with almost no assistance from any other countries. Four years later China became a nuclear nation with some assistance from the USSR.</p><br>

            <p><br>In the early 1960s many leaders feared that more countries were going to develop nuclear weapons and that this could easily lead to nuclear war. The USA and the USSR took the lead in creating an international agreement that would stop the creation of nuclear weapons but still let nuclear energy be used for peaceful purposes. Resulting from this was the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty also known as the Nonproliferation Treaty or NPT, the NPT opened for signature on July 1, 1968.</p><br>
            
            <p>When the NPT came into force on March 5th, 1970, the NPT differentiated between two types of country, nuclear countries (USSR, USA, China, France and the UK) and non-nuclear countries (all other signatories). Nuclear countries agreed to not give other countries nuclear weapons or to tell them how to build nuclear weapons, nuclear countries also agreed to move towards the goal of total nuclear disarmament. Non-nuclear countries agreed to not acquire or build any nuclear weapons.</p><br>
            
            <p>The NPT was first signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and 59 other countries. China and France also signed the Treaty in 1992. In 1996, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan destroyed their nuclear weapons that were leftover from when the USSR fell apart, and signed the NPT as non-nuclear countries. By 2004, all members of the United Nations had signed the NPT except for India, Israel and Pakistan. However North Korea has recently pulled out of the treaty.</p>
