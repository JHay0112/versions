            <h1>Ethics of Nuclear Weapons</h1>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Ethics and nuclear weapons go hand in hand, academics, politicians, scientists and the general public are divided on the subject. There is constant ethical debate about whether or not countries should have nuclear weapons and/or test them.</p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <p>The first nuclear incident,  the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ended WWII effectively and cleanly, although there has been major debates over whether the USA did their best to avoid a nuclear conflict in the first place. It has been argued that the USA worded the surrender treaty before the bombings in such a way that they knew that Japan would never accept the treaty. It is argued that they did this to flex their nuclear might infront of the Soviet Union. The people who claim this viewpoint also say that this shows how the USA put itself above the Japanese people. There is another side to this argument, the pro-USA side claims that the actions of the USA saved lives as a long war between the USA and Japan wouldâ€™ve led to more lives lost. Either way lots of people died or would've died.</p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <p>In the previous situation we see how there are two sides to the use of nuclear weapons, people who are for them and the people who are against them. With the previous scenario we can also see, when looking at the history, that the people of the USA at the time were pro-nukes but as time has gone on the public view has changed and has moved to a majority anti-nuke.</p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <p>Overall, the public view of nuclear weapons has turned against them and general ethics are against them due to their devastating effects. In my opinion, nuclear weapons should be destroyed due to their inhumane effects and the amount of political sway they hold. In general, ethics agree, international agreements have stopped the use of chemical and biological weapons due to them being inhumane, why has this not happened with nuclear weapons, which are just as dangerous, if not more.</p>
