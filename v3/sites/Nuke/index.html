            <h1>The Fallout</h1>
            <h2>Digi-tech, Science, Social-Studies</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p>Nuclear bombs are currently the most powerful weapon on earth. The have major social, political, economical and environmental effects. We have only seen them in warfare twice, the bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the USA, the USA dropped two bombs, one on both cities, causing the Japanese to surrender, ending World War II. The two bombs dropped on the Japanese are almost tame compared to the powerful thermonuclear warheads of today.</p><br>
            
            <h2>How Nuclear Weapons Work</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Everything in the entire universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms and these atoms are made up of three subatomic particles called protons, neutrons and electrons. In the centre of every single atom is the nucleus, plural nuclei, where neutrons and protons are found (The electrons orbit the nucleus).</p><br>
            
            <p>Fission is the process where heavy atoms split into smaller nuclei, releasing energy in the process. This can spontaneously occur, but with nuclei of certain atoms the fission process can be caused by outside influence. To cause a fission reaction a neutron is shot at the nucleus of the atom, causing the atom to destabilize and start the fission process. In some isotopes of uranium and plutonium, the fission releases neutrons, which can start a chain reaction. Fusion is the opposite, when light atoms are exposed to high temperatures and pressure they can fuse together releasing energy.</p><br>

            <p>All nuclear weapons use fission in some way to generate an explosion. The first nuclear weapon used in combat “Little Boy” worked by shooting a cylinder of uranium-235 at a target of the made of uranium-235 (all inside the bomb casing). Either piece of uranium-235 is not enough to reach critical mass by itself but when the two pieces collide it reaches critical mass, starting a fission reaction.</p><br>
            
            <p>Modern nuclear weapons reach critical mass through a different procedure. Critical mass is affected by the nuclear material’s density, a higher density equals a lower critical mass. Instead of colliding near critical pieces of nuclear material like “Little Boy” did, modern weapons detonate explosives around a near critical sphere of nuclear material.The force from the blast causes the density of the nuclear material to increase and the atoms to come closer together, once the material reaches critical mass, neutrons are injected into the material, causing a fission chain reaction and producing a nuclear explosion.</p><br>
            
            <p>Fusion weapons (also known as thermonuclear and hydrogen) use the energy from a fission reaction to fuse hydrogen atoms together. The energy released creates a fireball that reaches temperatures close to that of the sun's core.</p><br>

            <p>A thermonuclear warhead uses two explosions, a primary and secondary. The primary consists of an explosive charge surrounding a fission fuel surrounding a fusion fuel, with a neutron generator aiming in. The secondary is set off by the primary, the secondary consists of fission fuel surrounding fusion fuel surrounding a fission fuel.</p><br>
            
            <p>A pure fission primary is very inefficient as the plutonium will blow up before most of the plutonium can go through the fission process. Instead, the reaction is boosted by having deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen) in the centre of the plutonium. As the plutonium fissions, the hydrogen goes through fusion, releasing neutrons and aids the fission process.</p><br>
            
            <p>The secondary part of the thermonuclear warhead doesn’t just consist of a fusion fuel it also has a fission core of either uranium or plutonium. As the primary causes the density of the secondary to increase, the uranium or plutonium core becomes critical end goes through fission, heating the hydrogen fusion fuel and causing a fusion reaction. The fusion reaction releases neutrons, these neutrons hit a fission fuel surrounding the fusion causing it to fission, this fission reaction is the main contributor to the overall explosion.</p><br>
            
            <p>A thermonuclear without the outer casing of a fission fuel is called a neutron bomb, as without the uranium casing a lot more neutrons are released in the explosion, this causes a lot more radiation in the area where the bomb is deployed.</p>
